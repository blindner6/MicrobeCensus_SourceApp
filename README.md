This is a fork of Nayfach and Pollard's tool MicrobeCensus.

A `TypeError` is created in the `check_rapsearch()` subroutine of `run_pipeline()` by a recent version of Python. This has been fixed in this fork so that the tool can be deployed in SourceApp. 

For the original tool, see:

And the context of its deployment in SourceApp:
